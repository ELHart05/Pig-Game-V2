Fun 2 player game with the dice in the center üé≤ . Always this stupid random dice, right?

Easy-to-play game written in pure HTML CSS Sass (SCSS) JavaScript Also using the live-sass-compiler node-sass sass-loader for fast compiling, but possibly this is not what you want to know about but more about the rules of the game.

    <li>The game has 2 players you can choose the name of them, they playing in rounds</li>
    <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score</li>
